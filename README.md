# 🌌 Static Dreamscapes Automation System

> A fully automated pipeline for generating, analyzing, and rendering 3-hour Synthwave / Lo-Fi / Vaporwave mixes for the **Static Dreamscapes Lo-Fi YouTube Channel**.  
> This system transforms Suno-generated songs into cohesive, branded, royalty-free mixes — organized by emotional arc and produced entirely through automated scripts and AI agents.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Static Dreamscapes aims to maintain **continuity, quality, and efficiency** in producing long-form ambient music mixes.  
This system automates every step of that process:

1. **Track Management:** Ingest new Suno-generated audio files and sort them into phases.
2. **Pre-Processing:** Rename, prefix, and order songs chronologically.
3. **Audio Analysis:** Extract BPM, key, brightness, and loudness data via Python.
4. **Validation:** Confirm that total mix runtime is ~3 hours.
5. **Rendering:** Use FFmpeg to crossfade and export the final seamless mix.
6. **Metadata:** Store song data, analysis results, and build history as structured JSON.

## ⚙️ Automation Pipeline

The workflow is fully orchestrated by `agent/orchestrator.py`.

### 🔁 Step-by-Step Flow

| Step | Action                 | Script / Module          | Description                                        |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Detect new Suno tracks | `orchestrator.py`        | Waits for new `.mp3` files in `/Arc_Library/`.     |
| 2    | Sort + rename tracks   | `rename_by_mod_time.sh`  | Orders tracks by modification date.                |
| 3    | Add prefixes           | `prepend_tracks.sh`      | Prepends A*/B* to maintain arc grouping.           |
| 4    | Analyze tracks         | `analyze_audio.py`       | Extracts duration, BPM, RMS, brightness, and key.  |
| 5    | Verify runtime         | `track_length_report.sh` | Confirms total runtime ≈ 3 hours.                  |
| 6    | Build mix              | `build_mix.sh`           | Uses FFmpeg to crossfade and merge tracks.         |
| 7    | Update metadata        | `orchestrator.py`        | Writes `song_index.json` and `build_history.json`. |

## 🧠 Phase Structure

Each 3-hour mix follows the same four-phase emotional arc:

| Phase | Title            | Description                                      |
| ----- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Calm Intro       | Ambient, nostalgic, and warm opening atmosphere. |
| **2** | Flow / Focus     | Steady mid-tempo tracks to sustain attention.    |
| **3** | Uplift / Clarity | Bright, optimistic energy; creative momentum.    |
| **4** | Reflective Fade  | Slow, analog-warm closing for introspection.     |

Each phase's tracks live under `/Arc_Library/Phase_X_*/` and have metadata mirrored in `/metadata/Phase_X.json`.

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### 🐚 Shell Scripts (`/scripts/`)

These handle **mechanical** tasks — renaming, sorting, verifying, and rendering.  
They are lightweight, modular, and executed sequentially by the Python orchestrator.

See [`scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md`](scripts/README_SCRIPTS.md) for full details.

### 🧠 Python Agent (`/agent/`)

This is the **intelligent layer** — it decides _when_ to run shell scripts, how to handle errors, and how to generate metadata.

- [`orchestrator.py`](agent/orchestrator.py): Main entry point, runs pipeline end-to-end.
- [`analyze_audio.py`](agent/analyze_audio.py): Performs analysis using `librosa`.
- [`agent/docs/`](agent/docs/): Deep technical reference for all internal logic.

See [`agent/README_AGENT.md`](agent/README_AGENT.md).

### 🗃️ Metadata (`/metadata/`)

Stores track data, analysis results, and mix history.  
Each JSON file corresponds to a phase or dataset, maintained by the agent.

See [`metadata/README_METADATA.md`](metadata/README_METADATA.md).

---

## 🧭 How to Run the System

### ▶️ Local Run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install librosa numpy ffmpeg-python watchdog

# 2. Make shell scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# 3. Start the orchestrator
python3 agent/orchestrator.py
```

This will automatically detect new `.mp3` files dropped into `/Arc_Library/` and trigger the full pipeline.

### 🧩 Example Output

**Rendered Mix:**

```
Rendered/Final_Mix_2025_10_29.mp3
```

**Metadata Updates:**

```
metadata/
├── Phase_1.json
├── Phase_2.json
├── song_index.json
└── build_history.json
```

**Log Example:**

```
[2025-10-29 23:34:22] [rename_by_mod_time.sh] SUCCESS — 24 files processed.
[2025-10-29 23:35:17] [analyze_audio.py] SUCCESS — 24 tracks analyzed.
[2025-10-29 23:38:41] [build_mix.sh] SUCCESS — Final mix rendered (03:00:12).
```

## 🧰 Development Notes

- Do not modify `/Rendered/` manually. It is rebuilt on every successful run.
- Back up `/metadata/` periodically to preserve analysis data.
- Script names must remain consistent with docs or the orchestrator will not detect them.
- The agent logs to `logs/orchestrator.log` and rotates logs after each build.

## 🚀 Vision

The Static Dreamscapes system is built to evolve:

- 🎧 **Curation Intelligence:** Select songs automatically based on BPM and tonal flow.
- 🧠 **AI Adaptation:** Dynamically generate playlists per theme (rainy night, analog sunrise, etc.).
- ☁️ **Deployment Ready:** Future integration with cloud rendering and YouTube auto-uploads.
- 🔁 **Continuous Creation:** Move toward fully hands-off music production and publishing.
