## 3. DESCRIPTION (Final Public Copy)
Neon rain outside. Quiet code inside. Perfect focus.
A rainy night hums softly beyond the window as neon reflections ripple across the glass. The CRT glows teal in a dim, purple-lit room. This 3-hour Lo-Fi + Vaporwave mix is built for deep focus, designed to support coding, studying, writing, and long late-night creative sessions.
Royalty-free and safe for content creators.

- Late-night study sessions
- Creative writing and deep work
- Calm ambient background focus

## 4. VISUAL DESIGN (Image + Animation Notes)
### Image Prompt — Neon Rain Coding Desk
Cozy neon-lit corner desk setup on a rainy night, teal CRT monitor glowing with terminal-style text, magenta city lights outside a single rain-soaked window, stacked analog audio equipment with subtle LEDs, indoor plants framing the scene, vaporwave color palette, glass desk reflections, large framed wall art, no mirrors, no duplicate reflections.
### Animation Notes
- Vertical rain streaks on the window only
- Subtle city light bokeh pulses
- Light CRT flicker approximately every 20–30 seconds
- Slight plant sway
- No camera movement
- No added reflections or motion blur
## 5. MUSIC ARC STRUCTURE
### Anchor Phrase
neon rain calm
All prompts must end with:
— neon rain calm
Excluded globally: saxophone, brass, solos
### Phase 1 — Urban Rainfall (opening ambience, slow immersion)
- [x] 1. sustained analog pad chords, slow attack and long release, rain-texture noise bed, soft tape hiss layer, no drums, stable root movement — neon rain calm
- [x] 2. layered vaporwave pads with gentle detune, slow harmonic change every 8–16 bars, distant sub swell, faint vinyl crackle, no rhythmic pulse — neon rain calm
- [x] 3. mono synth drone with slow LFO filter sweep, high pad shimmer layer, rain-texture noise floor, long reverb tail, no percussion — neon rain calm
### Phase 2 — Deep Focus Flow (creative pulse, steady productivity)
- [x] 4. muted lo-fi drum loop, soft kick and rim, steady 4/4 pulse, warm analog bass holding root notes, simple chord stabs, rain-texture layer behind mix — neon rain calm
- [x] 5. midtempo lo-fi beat with brushed hats, sidechained pad chords, analog bass with minimal variation, stable 8-bar loop structure, light tape saturation — neon rain calm
- [x] 6. restrained drum machine pattern, low-velocity hits, filtered arpeggio repeating one motif, pads carrying harmonic weight, subtle static layer — neon rain calm
- [x] 7. steady lo-fi rhythm, soft kick and hat, layered pads with slow chord progression, no lead melody, rain-texture noise bed, warm midrange — neon rain calm
### Phase 3 — Midnight Stillness (minimal, reflective center)
- [x] 8. chord-driven vaporwave track, extended minor chords, muted drum loop, analog bass following chord roots, long reverb tails, subtle tape hiss — neon rain calm
- [x] 9. minimal drum pattern with softened transients, slow pad movement, bass holding long notes, gentle detune on chords, wide stereo wash — neon rain calm
- [x] 10. steady focus groove, deeper analog chords, sparse percussion accents, slow filter automation on pads, restrained harmonic lift, no melodic lead — neon rain calm
### Phase 4 — Vaporwave Dreamfade (dissolving outro, calm release)
- [x] 11. sustained pad chords with decreasing rhythmic presence, drums reduced to sparse hits, rain-texture layer emphasized, extended reverb decay — neon rain calm
- [x] 12. beatless ambient pad layers, slow harmonic movement, subtle noise texture, gentle tape flutter, no bass rhythm — neon rain calm
- [x] 13. single evolving pad chord, long release, rain-texture noise bed, gentle tape hiss, slow fade toward silence — neon rain calm

## 7. BRAND NOTES
- Rain-night videos are a top secondary performer after coding desk mixes.
- Optimal teal-to-magenta balance improves browse CTR.
- CRT screens must remain minimal and readable.
- Use subtle fog vignette only for depth, never dominance.
- Pairs well with night-coding and rain-desk themed uploads.
