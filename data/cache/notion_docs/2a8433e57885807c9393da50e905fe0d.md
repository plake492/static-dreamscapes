## 3. DESCRIPTION (Final Public Copy)
The hum of an analogue console. Soft static in the air. A desk built for focus.
This 3-hour LoFi + Vaporwave mix is designed for deep study and late-night concentration, inspired by vintage consoles, CRT monitors, and the warm imperfections of analogue gear. Gentle static, tape hiss, and slow-moving synths create a calm, distraction-free environment for long sessions.
Royalty-free and safe for creators.
Best For
- Exam study and late-night homework
- Deep, uninterrupted focus

CRT glow • VHS static • analogue warmth • tape hiss • nostalgic calm
## 4. VISUAL DESIGN (Image + Animation Notes)
### Visual Reference
Use the top-right image from the Screenshot 2025-11-29 collage
(Corner desk with prominent analogue audio gear).
### Image Prompt — Analogue Console Desk
Cozy corner desk setup at night, dominated by vintage analogue audio equipment and a teal-green CRT monitor displaying terminal-style text. Subtle city glow through a window, VHS static influence, tape machine aesthetic, dark ambient lighting, soft shadows, nostalgic tone, no modern devices, no rain.
### Animation Notes
- Constant, subtle VHS tracking wobble
- Very light static noise overlay
- Micro CRT flicker approximately every 20–30 seconds
- No camera movement
- No exaggerated glitch effects

Excluded globally: saxophone, brass, solos
### Phase 1 — VHS Static Haze (Atmospheric foundation, texture-forward)
- [x] 1. sustained analogue pad chords with slow attack and long release, constant VHS static layer, tape hiss noise floor, no rhythmic elements, stable tonal center — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 2. filtered analogue synth pads with gentle detune, slow harmonic movement every 8–16 bars, radio-like bandpass coloration, beatless structure — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 3. mono analogue drone with slow LFO modulation, sub-bass held as continuous tone, light tape saturation, no percussion — analogue focus vaporwave
### Phase 2 — Focused System Check (Controlled rhythm, locked-in flow)
- [x] 4. muted lo-fi drum pattern with soft kick and rim, steady looped groove, analogue bass sustaining root notes, simple chord stabs — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 5. classic drum-machine rhythm at low velocity, gated reverb snare texture, warm analogue bass, pads carrying harmonic progression — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 6. restrained lo-fi rhythm with brushed percussion, subtle tape warble on master bus, repeating chord cycle, minimal variation — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 7. arpeggiated analogue bass repeating fixed pattern, soft kick and hat loop, slow-moving pad harmony, no lead melody — analogue focus vaporwave
### Phase 3 — Deep Nostalgia (Reflective harmony, reduced motion)
- [x] 8. extended minor-key pad chords with wide reverb tails, minimal drum presence, analogue bass following chord roots — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 9. sparse percussion with long decay, layered analogue pads shifting harmony gradually, consistent mid-low energy — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 10. slow dreamwave-style pad progression, softened transients, subtle rhythmic pulse, emotionally neutral sustain — analogue focus vaporwave
### Phase 4 — Tape Loop Calm (Energy release, ambient dissolve)
- [x] 11. looping tape-style pad chord with gradual filter roll-off, static and hiss textures prominent, percussion removed — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 12. beatless analogue drone with machine-like hum tones, long delay feedback, slow harmonic fade — analogue focus vaporwave
- [x] 13. single evolving pad layer with extended release, constant noise floor, final slow decay toward silence — analogue focus vaporwave

## 7. BRAND NOTES
- Strong nostalgia-forward entry without relying on rain.
- VHS and tape textures should remain subtle, not overpowering.
- Analogue gear density and CRT readability are critical.
- This theme pairs well with night-study and retro-console follow-ups.
