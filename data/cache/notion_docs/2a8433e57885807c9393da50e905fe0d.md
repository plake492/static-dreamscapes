### Image Prompt — Analogue Console Desk
Cozy corner desk setup at night, dominated by vintage analogue audio equipment and a teal-green CRT monitor displaying terminal-style text. Subtle city glow through a window, VHS static influence, tape machine aesthetic, dark ambient lighting, soft shadows, nostalgic tone, no modern devices, no rain.
### Animation Notes
- Constant, subtle VHS tracking wobble
- Very light static noise overlay
