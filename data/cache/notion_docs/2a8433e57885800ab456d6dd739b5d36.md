## 4. VISUAL DESIGN (Image + Animation Notes)
### Image Prompt — Neon Rain Coding Desk
Cozy neon-lit corner desk on a rainy night, teal CRT monitor glowing with terminal-style text, magenta city lights outside a single rain-soaked window, stacked analog audio equipment with subtle LEDs, vaporwave color palette, glass reflections, cinematic lighting, no modern screens.
### Animation Notes
- Gentle vertical rain streaks on the window only
- Subtle city light bokeh pulses outside
- Light CRT flicker approximately every 20–30 seconds
- No camera movement

Excluded globally: saxophone, brass, solos
### Phase 1 — Urban Rainfall
(Ambient, texture-forward)
- [x] 1. ambient synth pad introduction with deep bass, gentle tape hiss, city traffic and rain on glass textures, slow tempo — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 2. distant traffic reverb with warm pad layers, muted reflections, slow atmospheric movement with vinyl crackle — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 3. mellow lo-fi beat with filtered piano loop, soft rain ambience, minimal percussion — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 4. dark moody synth drone with slow delay, emphasis on rain texture and deep bass pads — neon rain focus flow
### Phase 2 — Deep Focus Flow
(Steady rhythm, productive energy)
- [x] 5. mid-tempo lo-fi synthwave groove with clean analog bass, rhythmic drum machine, restrained vaporwave delay — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 6. steady four-on-the-floor lo-fi pulse, clear synth lead in minor key, soft controlled percussion — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 7. rhythmic synth chords with driving but mellow pace, clean and focused energy, minimal noise — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 8. upbeat lo-fi track with smooth synth melody, consistent tempo, light tape warble — neon rain focus flow
### Phase 3 — Midnight Stillness
(Minimal, reflective)
- [x] 9. minimalist vaporwave chords with deep reverb, quiet vinyl crackle, simple drum loop, slow and introspective — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 10. subdued midnight bass with smooth analog texture, airy atmospheric synth layers — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 11. minimal percussion with long sustained pads, focus on tape hiss warmth and reverb trails — neon rain focus flow
### Phase 4 — Vaporwave Dreamfade
(Ambient, dissolving outro)
- [x] 12. warm analog synth pad with slowly fading lo-fi beat, long delay tails, dissolving into rain and tape static — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 13. ambient closer focused on rain textures, white noise, and distant synth drone, no percussion — neon rain focus flow
- [x] 14. final analogue fade-out with sustained synth chord, tape static takeover, CRT hum dissolving into silence — neon rain focus flow

## 7. BRAND NOTES
- Rain should support focus, not dominate the frame.
- CRT readability and analog desk density are mandatory.
- Keep rhythms restrained to avoid listener fatigue.
- This theme anchors your night / coding identity pillar.
