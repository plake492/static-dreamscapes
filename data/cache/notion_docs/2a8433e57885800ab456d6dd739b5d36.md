## 3. DESCRIPTION (Final Public Copy)
A rainy night hums softly outside. Neon reflections ripple across the glass. The CRT glows teal.
This 3-hour LoFi + Synthwave deep-focus mix is built for late-night coding and long, uninterrupted work sessions. Soft rain ambience, restrained rhythms, and warm analog textures create a calm, focused environment designed to support concentration without distraction.
Royalty-free and safe for content creators.
Best For
- Coding and software development
- Late-night study and deep focus
- Ambient background work sessions
Aesthetic
Neon rain • CRT glow • analog warmth • city reflections • night focus
## 4. VISUAL DESIGN (Image + Animation Notes)
### Image Prompt — Neon Rain Coding Desk
Cozy neon-lit corner desk on a rainy night, teal CRT monitor glowing with terminal-style text, magenta city lights outside a single rain-soaked window, stacked analog audio equipment with subtle LEDs, vaporwave color palette, glass reflections, cinematic lighting, no modern screens.
### Animation Notes
- Gentle vertical rain streaks on the window only
- Subtle city light bokeh pulses outside
- Light CRT flicker approximately every 20–30 seconds
- No camera movement
## 5. MUSIC ARC STRUCTURE — Suno Prompts
### Anchor Phrase
neon rain focus flow
All prompts must end with:
— neon rain focus flow
Excluded globally: saxophone, brass, solos
### Phase 1 — Urban Rainfall (Ambient entry, rain texture bed, low motion)
- [ ] 1. sustained synth pads with low-pass filtering, deep sub held in long notes, constant rain texture layer, gentle tape hiss, beatless structure — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 2. warm pad layers with slow chord movement, distant room-tone texture, vinyl crackle layer, rain ambience as continuous bed, beatless structure — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 3. lo-fi beat at low velocity with filtered piano loop, soft kick and rim, rain layer under mix, bass sustaining root notes — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 4. mono synth drone with slow delay feedback, deep pad chords, sub movement in long notes, rain texture prominent, near-beatless structure — neon rain focus flow
### Phase 2 — Deep Focus Flow (Locked-in groove, stable energy, coding-safe)
- [ ] 5. mid-tempo lo-fi drum loop with softened transients, clean analog bass groove repeating a fixed pattern, chord stabs on simple cycle, subtle delay on mids — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 6. steady drum-machine pulse with low-velocity kit, minor-key chord progression on pads, bass following chord roots, limited lead content — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 7. rhythmic synth-chord loop with restrained dynamics, soft kick and hat pattern, warm pad bed, minimal effects movement — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 8. upbeat but controlled lo-fi groove, smooth synth melody with limited range, stable tempo loop, light tape warble texture, bass locked to chord roots — neon rain focus flow
### Phase 3 — Midnight Stillness (Reduced motion, reflective harmony, minimal percussion)
- [ ] 9. extended chord pads with deep reverb tails, simple low-velocity drum loop, vinyl crackle layer, bass in sustained notes — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 10. subdued bass line with warm analog saturation, airy pad layers, minimal percussion texture, slow harmonic movement — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 11. long-sustain pads carrying harmony, tape hiss texture, sparse soft percussion hits with long decay, predictable loop structure — neon rain focus flow
### Phase 4 — Vaporwave Dreamfade (Dissolve, rain-forward, ambient close)
- [ ] 12. warm pad chord cycle with gradually reduced drum presence, long delay trails, rain texture increasing in prominence, slow energy release — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 13. ambient closer focused on rain texture bed, white-noise layer, distant synth drone, beatless structure, stable tonal center — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 14. final sustained chord with long release, tape-static texture rising, low hum tone under mix, gradual decay toward silence, beatless structure — neon rain focus flow

## 7. BRAND NOTES
- Rain should support focus, not dominate the frame.
- CRT readability and analog desk density are mandatory.
- Keep rhythms restrained to avoid listener fatigue.
- This theme anchors your night / coding identity pillar.
