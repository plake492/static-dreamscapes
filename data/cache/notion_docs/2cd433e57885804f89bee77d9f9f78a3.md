## 3. DESCRIPTION (Final Public Copy — Plain Text)
Neon light hums softly outside the window.
Rain streaks slide down the glass.
A CRT monitor glows steadily in a quiet room built for focus.
This 3-hour LoFi and Synthwave mix is designed for deep night coding, studying, writing, and long creative work sessions. Warm analog textures, restrained rhythms, and subtle rain ambience create an immersive nighttime workspace without distraction.
The energy stays calm and consistent, evolving gently from early night focus into deep midnight flow.
All music is royalty free and safe for content creators.
Best for:
- Late-night coding and development
- Studying and deep focus
- Writing and creative work
- Quiet night productivity
Aesthetic:
Neon rain glow • CRT terminal text • analog desk gear • warm interior lamp • cool city reflections • focused night atmosphere
## 4. VISUAL DESIGN (Image + Animation Instructions)
### Chosen Image Style
Retro CRT coding desk • glowing monochrome CRT text (green or teal) • analog synth gear • cassette or reel-to-reel accent • plants framing the desk • rain-streaked window • neon city light reflections (subtle, not cyberpunk) • warm interior lamp vs cool exterior light • high clarity for thumbnail readability
### AI Prompt
Cozy retro nighttime coding desk inspired by late-80s and early-90s technology, cinematic composition with slight angled perspective. Large CRT monitor centered on desk displaying clear glowing terminal text. Analog synth gear and cassette decks on desk, warm desk lamp lighting. Large window behind desk with rain streaks and soft neon city light reflections, dark blue and purple night tones. Plants framing the scene, subtle haze, soft shadows, clean readable shapes, calm focused atmosphere.
### Animation Notes
- Gentle rain streak movement on window
- Subtle CRT flicker (very low intensity)
- Interior lamp glow breathing slowly
- No camera movement
- No harsh reflections or glare

### Phase 1 — Neon Night Entry (BPM 50–60)
(Ambient foundation, minimal rhythm, tonal establishment)
- [ ] 1. sustained analog pad chords, slow attack and long release, low-pass filtered, no drums, subtle tape saturation, stable root movement — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 2. layered vaporwave pads with gentle detune, slow harmonic changes every 8–16 bars, faint noise floor, no rhythmic pulse — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 3. mono synth drone with slow LFO modulation, secondary high pad layer, very light sub movement, no percussion — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 2 — Locked-In Focus Flow (BPM 60–72)
(Rhythmic entry, consistent groove, focus-safe)
- [ ] 4. muted lo-fi drum pattern, soft kick and rim, steady 4/4 pulse, warm analog bass playing sustained notes, simple chord stabs — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 5. midtempo lo-fi beat with brushed percussion, sidechained pad chords, analog bass with minimal variation, stable loop structure — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 6. restrained drum machine pattern, low-velocity hits, filtered arpeggio playing repeated notes, pads carrying harmonic weight — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 7. steady lo-fi rhythm, soft kick and hat, layered pads with slow chord progression, no lead melody — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 3 — Midnight Drift (BPM 68–76)
(Deeper harmony, slight emotional weight, still controlled)
- [ ] 8. midtempo lo-fi groove, softened transients, analog bass following chord roots, pads shifting harmony gradually over time — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 9. chord-driven synthwave track, extended minor chords, muted drum pattern, subtle reverb tail, minimal melodic movement — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 10. steady focus beat, layered pads with slow filter automation, bass holding long notes, no arpeggiated lead — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 4 — Rainy Fade (BPM 50–60)
(Energy release, return to ambient, long tails)
- [ ] 11. sustained pad chords with decreasing rhythmic presence, drums reduced to sparse hits, extended reverb decay — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 12. beatless ambient pad layers, slow harmonic movement, subtle noise texture, no bass rhythm — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 13. single evolving pad chord, long release, gentle tape hiss, no percussion, slow fade toward silence — vaporwave synthwave lofi
