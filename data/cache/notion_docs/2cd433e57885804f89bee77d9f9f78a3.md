Neon light hums softly outside the window.
Rain streaks slide down the glass.
A CRT monitor glows steadily in a quiet room built for focus.
This 3-hour LoFi and Synthwave mix is designed for deep night coding, studying, writing, and long creative work sessions. Warm analog textures, restrained rhythms, and subtle rain ambience create an immersive nighttime workspace without distraction.
The energy stays calm and consistent, evolving gently from early night focus into deep midnight flow.
All music is royalty free and safe for content creators.
