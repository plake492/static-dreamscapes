## 3. DESCRIPTION (Final Public Copy — Plain Text)
Perfect for programmers, designers, creatives, and night owls.
Step into a calm, neon-lit night where the city slows down and focus takes over. Rain taps softly against the window, a CRT monitor glows in the dark, and steady lo-fi synthwave rhythms guide you through long late-night coding, studying, or creative sessions.
This 3-hour royalty-free mix is built for deep focus without distractions. The energy stays grounded and consistent, helping you stay locked in while the rest of the world sleeps.
All music is royalty free and safe to use in streams, videos, or background content. Credit is appreciated but not required.

- Keep visuals darker and calmer than dusk or sunrise mixes.
- Rain should support focus, not overpower the scene.
- CRT readability and analog texture are mandatory.
