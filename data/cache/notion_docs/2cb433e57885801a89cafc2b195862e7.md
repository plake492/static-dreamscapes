## 2. MUSIC ARC STRUCTURE — 18 SUNO PROMPTS
### PHASE 1 — Neon Rain Calm (Ambient Entry)
(BPM 55–60 • Warm pads • Rain textures • Minimal rhythm)
- [ ] 1. “warm ambient lofi pads, soft rain texture, slow drifting chords, minimal percussion, deep night calm” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 2. “vaporwave chord swell, gentle static haze, low-frequency pads, spacious atmosphere, no rhythm drive” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 3. “muted analog pads, subtle rain ambience, airy harmonic movement, soft tape saturation” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 4. “slow vaporwave drift, warm synth layers, calm resonance, faint static, no drums” — neon rain focus flow
### PHASE 2 — Deep Focus Pulse (Rhythmic Lift)
(BPM 60–70 • Light beats • Warm bass • Coding flow energy)
- [ ] 5. “midtempo lofi beat, warm analog bass, smooth chords, steady pulse, stable focus energy” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 6. “rhythmic vaporwave pads, muted drum machine, soft percussive texture, deep concentration atmosphere” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 7. “gentle synth pulse, clean analog bassline, restrained beat, subtle uplift, controlled motion” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 8. “steady lofi rhythm, dreamy pads, warm tone shaping, relaxed but forward-moving energy” — neon rain focus flow
### PHASE 3 — Midnight Drift (Reflective + Deeper Harmonics)
(BPM 68–76 • Emotional undertones • Atmospheric layering)
- [ ] 9. “atmospheric vaporwave pads, introspective chord movement, softened percussion, night drift energy” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 10. “deep analog chord progression, filtered static texture, muted beat, warm contemplative tone” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 11. “smooth evolving pads, low subtle arps, gentle rhythm support, immersive nighttime focus” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 12. “emotional lofi synthscape, layered chords, slow rhythmic undercurrent, reflective mood” — neon rain focus flow
### PHASE 4 — Vaporwave Fade (Slow Dissolve)
(BPM 55–60 • Minimal rhythm • Long pads • Outro calm)
- [ ] 13. “slow vaporwave chord washes, static haze, minimal rhythmic movement, gentle fade energy” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 14. “analog pad swell, long decays, soft ambient noise, beatless or near-beatless structure” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 15. “distant harmonic pads, mellow synth tones, subtle movement, deeply calming drift” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 16. “warm ambient texture, dissolving chords, faint static, peaceful late-night fade out” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 17. “very soft vaporwave layers, minimal tonal shifts, quiet reflective atmosphere” — neon rain focus flow
- [ ] 18. “final ambient dissolution, long pad tail, subtle noise floor, quiet closure” — neon rain focus flow
