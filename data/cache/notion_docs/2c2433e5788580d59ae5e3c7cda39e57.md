## 🧭 7. BRAND NOTES
- Rain-night videos remain your most stable performers across CTR, AVD, and session watch behavior.
- Consistent teal CRT + warm lamp aesthetic strongly correlates with retention.
- Plant silhouettes, window rain streaks, and analog gear improve click-through.
- Avoid overusing purple fog — keep it subtle, not distracting.
