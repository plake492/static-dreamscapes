### 🎼 5. MUSIC ARC STRUCTURE
### Phase 1 — Nostalgic Warmth (soft entry, warm tone bed, light motion)
- [x] 1. sustained warm pad chords, slow attack and long release, subtle tape saturation, faint vinyl crackle, no drums, stable root movement — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 2. layered synth pads with gentle detune, slow harmonic change every 8–16 bars, soft noise floor, very light chorus, no rhythmic pulse — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 3. muted lo-fi drum loop, soft kick and rim, steady simple pulse, warm bass holding root notes, short chord stabs, light tape hiss — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 2 — Steady Focus (consistent groove, loop-safe, no surprises)
- [x] 4. muted lo-fi drum pattern, soft kick and hat, steady 4/4 pulse, analog bass sustained notes, pads carrying harmony, minimal variation — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 5. midtempo lo-fi beat with brushed percussion, sidechained pad chords, bass following chord roots, stable 8-bar loop structure, subtle saturation — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 6. restrained drum machine groove, low-velocity hits, filtered arpeggio repeating short motif, pads holding chord weight, soft noise layer — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 7. steady lo-fi rhythm, soft kick and hat, slow chord progression in pads, bass holding long notes, gentle reverb tail — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 3 — Energetic Flow (uplift without intensity, clean focus energy)
- [x] 8. synthwave-leaning focus groove, clean drum machine hits at low velocity, steady bassline, bright pad layer, repeating arpeggio motif, stable loop — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 9. chord-driven retrowave groove, extended major/minor color chords, muted drums, bass following chord roots, subtle stereo widen, minimal lead movement — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 10. steady focus beat, layered pads with slow filter automation, arpeggio kept low in mix, bass holding long notes, controlled harmonic lift no percussion — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 4 — Reflective Fade (release energy, long tails, dissolve)
- [x] 11. sustained pad chords with decreasing rhythmic presence, drums reduced to sparse hits, extended reverb decay, subtle tape flutter — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 12. beatless ambient pad layers, slow harmonic movement, gentle noise texture, soft vinyl crackle, no bass rhythm — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 13. single evolving pad chord, long release, gentle tape hiss, soft noise floor, slow fade toward silence — vaporwave synthwave lofi
