## AI Prompt (Updated for Winter & No Neon City)
Ultra-cozy retro Christmas coding desk inspired by late-80s and early-90s technology. Cinematic, slightly angled composition for depth. A large CRT monitor centered on the desk displays clear monochrome terminal text (green or amber glow, sharp characters). Warm red desk lamp illuminating analog gear: reel-to-reel deck, cassette units, vintage synthesizers, retro keyboard.
Behind the desk, a large window shows a snowy winter evening scene: falling snow, frosted glass, soft streetlight bokeh, no neon city. A small decorated Christmas tree with glowing lights sits by the window. Garland and warm string lights hang above. Plants frame the desk naturally.
Lighting blends warm holiday tones with cool winter outdoor light. High detail but clean at thumbnail scale. Soft, inviting, cozy atmosphere. Vaporwave-lofi-synthwave aesthetic adapted to winter theme. Perfect for loop-ready animation.
