## 3. DESCRIPTION (Final Public Copy — Plain Text)
Rain settles over the city as daylight fades into evening.
The sky shifts from warm sunset tones to deep blue night.
Inside, the CRT hums softly and the steady rhythm of lo-fi synthwave keeps you focused.
This 3 hour Lo-Fi and Synthwave mix is designed for deep focus during evening and late-night work sessions. Smooth analog textures, subtle rain ambience, and restrained rhythms create a calm, immersive environment without distractions.
The energy slowly evolves from warm dusk into quiet night, making it ideal for long coding sessions, studying, writing, or creative work.
All music is royalty free and safe to use in streams, videos, or background content.
Best for:
- Coding and software development
- Evening and late-night study
- Writing and creative focus
- Calm background productivity
Vibe and aesthetic:
Rain on windows, dusk light fading to night, CRT glow, analog gear, soft static, cozy city atmosphere
