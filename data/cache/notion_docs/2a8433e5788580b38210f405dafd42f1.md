### 🌙 Quiet rain. Soft CRT glow. A room filled with memory.
“Static Reflections” is a dreamwave lo-fi mix designed for stillness — late-night journaling, soft study sessions, or calming your mind before sleep.

## 🎼 5. MUSIC ARC STRUCTURE
### ⭐ Anchor Phrase
### “soft rain memory — intimate, quiet, emotional dreamwave.”
(repeat at end of every line to lock Suno into the theme)
### Phase 1 — Quiet Glow (Soft entry, intimate texture, low motion)
- [ ] 1. warm pad chords with slow attack, constant rain texture bed, gentle tape hiss noise floor, beatless structure — soft rain memory
- [ ] 2. analogue hum layer with subtle detune, slow chord changes every 8–16 bars, vinyl crackle texture, near-beatless structure — soft rain memory
- [ ] 3. muted lo-fi drum loop at very low velocity, soft kick and rim, sustained pads carrying harmony, rain texture under mix — soft rain memory
### Phase 2 — Dreamwave Pulse (Gentle groove, emotional drift, stable loop)
- [ ] 4. warm bass in sustained notes, airy pad progression, soft drum-machine pulse, minimal melodic movement, predictable 4–8 bar loop — soft rain memory
- [ ] 5. repeating dreamwave synth motif with limited note range, sidechained pad chords, low-velocity percussion, rain texture constant — soft rain memory
- [ ] 6. soft keys on slow chord cycle, tape saturation and slight warble, sparse hats with low brightness, bass following chord roots — soft rain memory
### Phase 3 — Bedroom Stillness (Reduced motion, reflective harmony, minimal rhythm)
- [ ] 7. minimal percussion with long decay, nostalgic pad layers shifting slowly, stable tonal center, rain texture bed — soft rain memory
- [ ] 8. drifting pads with extended reverb tails, subtle noise floor, bass held as continuous tone, beatless structure — soft rain memory
- [ ] 9. gentle chord bloom on pads, slow harmonic movement, sparse soft kick, predictable loop structure, rain texture constant — soft rain memory
### Phase 4 — Hazy Fade (Ambient dissolve, rain-forward, quiet close)
- [ ] 10. rain texture emphasized with steady noise floor, drone layer with slow modulation, percussion removed, gradual energy release — soft rain memory
- [ ] 11. analogue hiss layer with long pad sustain, soft delay trails, minimal harmonic movement, near-beatless structure — soft rain memory
- [ ] 12. sustained hum tone with single slow chord cycle, long release and reverb tail, rain texture constant, decay toward silence — soft rain memory
