## 4. VISUAL DESIGN (Image + Animation Notes)
### Image Prompt — Nebula Desk (No Rain)
Cinematic nighttime desk setup with purple and blue neon lighting, glowing CRT monitor displaying terminal-style text, retro keyboard, stacked analog audio equipment, soft ambient haze, plants framing the desk, vaporwave palette, subtle dreamy stylization, clean lighting, no rain, no reflections, no mirrors.
### Animation Notes
- Subtle neon pulse (purple to blue)
- Dim CRT flicker
- Very light ambient dust
- No particles suggesting rain or fog
- Zero camera movement
- Avoid overly saturated pinks
## 5. MUSIC ARC STRUCTURE — Suno Prompts
### Anchor Phrase
neon-night focus — quiet late-night tech energy
All prompts must end with:
— vaporwave synthwave lofi
Excluded globally: saxophone, brass, solos
### Phase 1 — Neon Quiet
(Ambient foundation, minimal rhythm, tonal establishment)
- [ ] 1. lofi synthwave, sustained analog pad chords with slow attack and long release, gentle saturation, stable harmonic center, low melodic density — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 2. lofi synthwave, layered vaporwave pads with subtle detune, slow harmonic changes over extended phrases, faint noise floor, no rhythmic emphasis — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 3. lofi synthwave, mono synth drone with slow modulation, secondary high pad layer, very light sub movement, ambient tonal foundation — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 2 — Tech Pulse
(Rhythmic entry, consistent groove, focus-safe)
- [ ] 4. lofi synthwave, muted drum machine groove with soft transients, analog bass playing sustained root notes, midrange pad chords carrying harmony, stable loop structure — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 5. lofi synthwave, restrained drum pattern with low-velocity hits, analog bass locked to kick, warm pad chords with minimal variation — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 6. lofi synthwave, filtered arpeggio texture playing repeated notes, pads holding harmonic weight, subdued percussive support — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 7. lofi synthwave, steady rhythmic pulse, soft kick and hat, layered pads with slow chord progression, no foreground melody — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 3 — Deep Focus Drift
(Deeper harmony, emotional weight, still controlled)
- [ ] 8. lofi synthwave, steady groove with softened transients, analog bass following chord roots, pads shifting harmony gradually over time — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 9. lofi synthwave, chord-driven pad progression with extended minor voicings, muted rhythmic support, subtle reverb tails — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 10. lofi synthwave, sustained focus rhythm, layered pads with slow filter automation, bass holding long notes, controlled density — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 4 — Cosmic Fade
(Energy release, return to ambient, long tails)
- [ ] 11. lofi synthwave, sustained pad chords with decreasing rhythmic presence, drums reduced to sparse hits, extended reverb decay — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 12. lofi synthwave, beat-minimal ambient pad layers, slow harmonic drift, soft noise floor, spacious tonal decay — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 13. lofi synthwave, single evolving pad chord, long release, gentle tape saturation, gradual fade toward silence — vaporwave synthwave lofi

## 7. BRAND NOTES
- This is one of your strongest non-rain aesthetics historically.
- Purple / blue tech scenes perform well in Browse without cannibalizing rainy uploads.
- Avoid sunrise or warm daylight cues.
- Retro tech density and CRT readability are mandatory.
