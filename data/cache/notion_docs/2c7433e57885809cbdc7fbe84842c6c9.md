## 4. VISUAL DESIGN (Image + Animation Notes)
### Image Prompt — Nebula Desk (No Rain)
Cinematic nighttime desk setup with purple and blue neon lighting, glowing CRT monitor displaying terminal-style text, retro keyboard, stacked analog audio equipment, soft ambient haze, plants framing the desk, vaporwave palette, subtle dreamy stylization, clean lighting, no rain, no reflections, no mirrors.
### Animation Notes
- Subtle neon pulse (purple to blue)
- Dim CRT flicker
- Very light ambient dust
- No particles suggesting rain or fog
- Zero camera movement
- Avoid overly saturated pinks
## 5. MUSIC ARC STRUCTURE — Suno Prompts
### Anchor Phrase
neon-night focus — quiet late-night tech energy
All prompts must end with:
— vaporwave synthwave lofi
Excluded globally: saxophone, brass, solos
### Phase 1 — Neon Quiet (BPM 50–60)
(Beatless, atmospheric, static-forward)
- [x] 1. low-light ambient pads, soft analog hum, freeform drift with no rhythmic accents, deep-night stillness — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 2. slowly shifting synth textures with gentle modulation, non-metric atmospheric wash, calm early-focus tone — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 3. warm CRT-like drone layers with subtle tape flutter, pure texture with zero pulse, immersive quiet — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 2 — Tech Pulse (BPM 60–72)
(Controlled rhythm, very soft drums, no surprises)
- [x] 4. midtempo lo-fi tech pulse with muted, ultra-soft drums, smooth analog bass, steady controlled groove — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 5. structured synth-chord progression with gentle static, lightly driven mids, stable focus energy — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 6. subtle retro arpeggio patterns, balanced low-end, softly gated pads, minimal percussive presence — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 7. layered synthwave pads with vaporwave coloration, restrained transient edges, steady flow — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 3 — Deep Focus Drift (BPM 68–76)
(Mid-energy, clean rhythm, cinematic but subtle)
- [x] 8. steady nighttime rhythm with softened drums, nostalgic keys, extended pad tails, calm forward motion — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 9. darker analog chords with muted rhythmic elements, introspective drifting energy — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 10. mid-energy focus track with gradual harmonic lift, no sharp percussive hits, warm analog tone — vaporwave synthwave lofi
### Phase 4 — Cosmic Fade (BPM 50–60)
(Return to beatless / minimal, dissolving energy)
- [x] 11. slow vaporwave pad movement, static haze, soft evolving drone, no beat presence, dissolving tension — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [x] 12. warm analog swell with gentle delay trails, freeform tempo, emotional wind-down texture — vaporwave synthwave lofi
- [ ] 13. drifting ambient chords with spaced-out harmonics, soft dissolve into silence, no rhythmic cues — vaporwave synthwave lofi

## 7. BRAND NOTES
- This is one of your strongest non-rain aesthetics historically.
- Purple / blue tech scenes perform well in Browse without cannibalizing rainy uploads.
- Avoid sunrise or warm daylight cues.
- Retro tech density and CRT readability are mandatory.
